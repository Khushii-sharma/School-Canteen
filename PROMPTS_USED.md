# Tools Used:

During the development of this project, I took help from ChatGPT.

I mainly used it to:
- Understand the overall workflow of the application
- Get clarity on component structure and routing
- Think through state management using Context API
- Resolve common React errors during development

All the implementation, styling decisions, and final code structure were done by me after understanding the concepts.
